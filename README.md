# thesis
by Connor Fricke

LaTeX project and some included figures for my undergraduate research thesis in Physics at the Ohio State University. Defended in Spring semester of 2025.

This repository is not meant to be up to date at all times. It is just meant as a bookkeeper for occasional checkpoints as I finish developing my paper.
