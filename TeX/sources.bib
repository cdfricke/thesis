abstract="Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) were first introduced almost two and a half decades ago. Since then they have seen a rapid growth and have become a popular implementation media for digital circuits. The advancement in process technology has greatly enhanced the logic capacity of FPGAs and has in turn made them a viable implementation alternative for larger and complex designs. Further, programmable nature of their logic and routing resources has a dramatic effect on the quality of final device's area, speed, and power consumption.",
